  abstract={Using high-resolution multi-wavelength data from Chandra, HST, ALMA, and LOFAR, we discovered a chain of 19 young stellar “beads” connected to a giant X-ray cavity in an intermediate-redshift cool-core cluster. We show that this star formation pattern likely arose from gas cooling in the turbulent core, a powerful AGN outburst displacing cold gas, and tidal interactions from merging galaxies. These results highlight how feedback, cooling, and mergers interact in complex ways, offering insight into the chaotic processes that shaped galaxies and clusters in the early Universe.}

  abstract={Using deep $\sim$600 ks Chandra observations with archival GMRT and SINFONI data, we mapped the impact of repeated AGN outbursts in Abell 2597, revealing seven cavities, weak shocks to $\sim$150 kpc, and a 57 kpc surface brightness deficit likely shaped by sloshing-driven magnetic amplification. We show that although the AGN injects energy comparable to the cooling luminosity, radiative cooling persists at $\sim$15 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, fueling a massive cold gas reservoir that Bondi accretion cannot supply. These results support chaotic cold accretion as the dominant fueling mode and provide a detailed view of how cooling, feedback, and gas dynamics regulate cool-core cluster evolution.}

  abstract={By combining the strengths of the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model and the IllustrisTNG100 simulation, we developed the TNG SAM, a fast model calibrated to reproduce TNG’s gas and metal flows in stellar-feedback–dominated galaxies. We show that physically motivated updates to cooling, star formation, recycling, outflows, and gas re-accretion allow the SAM to recover TNG’s baryon cycle and global galaxy properties to within $\sim$30\% out to $z=6$. This work demonstrates that well-calibrated SAMs can capture much of the complex physics of hydrodynamical simulations while enabling efficient parameter studies across cosmological volumes.}

  title={The Extractive Gaze: How Race, Gender and Capitalism Shaped the Development of American Astronomical Stations in South Africa},
  author={Omoruyi, O.},
  abstract={Who is remembered in the history of science? Who gets credit for scientific discovery? Astronomy is often told as a story of lone geniuses making breakthroughs, but in reality, it is a history of infrastructure, labor, and global networks. In the early 20th century, Harvard’s Boyden Observatory and Yale’s Southern Station were established in South Africa to give American astronomers access to the Southern Hemisphere skies they couldn’t see from the North. At Boyden, observations of Cepheid variable stars led to the discovery of the period-luminosity law, which remains fundamental to how astronomers measure distances to faraway galaxies. Yet, while these scientific achievements are well-documented, the Black South African workers who built and maintained these observatories remain absent from the historical record. My Master’s thesis, The Extractive Gaze: Race and Capitalism in the Development of American Astronomical Stations in South Africa, examines how these observatories operated within a system of racial capitalism, where Black workers, despite playing a crucial role in scientific infrastructure, faced restricted land rights and economic opportunities. By tracing their role through observatory records, personal accounts, and histories of Black labor movements, this research reveals how global scientific expansion has often depended on overlooked labor and unequal power structures. Recognizing these histories not only deepens our understanding of astronomy’s past but also fosters a more inclusive vision for its future.},
